My research interests are in the field of deep learning, more specifically neural network architectures and optimization algorithms. I was amazed to see, as an example, how a change to a relatively simpler model architecture (the Googleâ€™s Transformer model), combined with an attention mechanism, provides significant improvements to translation problems with less training. My background is on physics (I have a PhD degree in theoretical physics), and I would like to use my physics technical background to benefit the neural networks research. I would also like to bring my contribution to creating the AI for a better and safer future that will benefit all of the people. I truly believe that Facebook is the perfect place to pursue such research. Besides having the infrastructure, there is the environment of openness and of sharing new ideas, and the amazingly talented people that you want to be surrounded by.
