With this letter I would like to apply for the Google AI Residency program starting in the Spring 2020. My research interests encompass deep learning neural networks, with a focus on finding novel architectures and improving the learning algorithms. More specific, I would like work in developing AI systems that can help design and optimize other AI systems. The ideas will be to have concurent NN training together, similar to the GANs, or NN develop new architectures and algorithms for solving specific problems. On the practical side this will facilitate independent communication between AI systems, and AI expert systems providing unconventional solutions to contemporary problems. To give just some ideas, for example a fleet of drones communicating in their own developed language, and training together in a descentralized manner, or developing novel materials and propulsion techniques for deep space travel.











Primary questions:
1. What are your primary research interests and why do you think they are important?
2. How would participating in the AI Residency help you to explore your research interests and achieve your goals?
3. Give an example of an open-ended research question or project you’ve worked on. What made it challenging and how did you overcome those challenges? Alternatively, summarize and critique a machine learning paper you have read that you found interesting.

Other:
How does your previous experience influence your interests and intuitions, and how can you leverage your skills to further research at Google?
Do you have the potential to excel?
What will you gain from Residency?
What will you contribute to Google’s research?
What will you contribute to Google’s culture?
