With this letter I would like to apply for the Google AI Residency program starting in the Spring 2020. My research interests encompass deep learning neural networks, with a focus on finding novel architectures and improving the learning algorithms. More specific, I would like to work in developing AI systems that can help design and optimize other AI systems. The ideas will be to have concurent NN training together, similar to the GANs, or NN develop new architectures and algorithms for solving specific problems. On the practical side this will facilitate independent communication between AI systems, and AI expert systems providing unconventional solutions to contemporary problems. To give just some ideas, for example a fleet of drones communicating in their own developed language, and training together in a descentralized manner, or developing novel materials and propulsion techniques for deep space travel.

Google has clearly the best capabilities for this: the most comprehensive data collections and the computational infrastructure that can help solving such tasks. Last but not least, Google has the incredibly talented people who can make a difference. This is why the AI Residency program will be of tremendous help for me to explore my research interests and to achieve my goals.

My background is in Physics, I have a PhD degree in theoretical Physics. I worked in both the national lab and academia environments, and, mostly in academia, the "currency" is peer-reviewed publications. You will find in my Google Scholar page that my research span a wide variety of topics, and so I would like to apply my Physics technical background to the AI field. I believe that I can leverage my skills to further AI research. For example, how about using the Fermi-Dirac distribution function as an activation function for certain neural networks, or conversely, how about using machine learning optimization techniques as a new way of designing materials with specific properties? I found the deep learning subfield of the machine learning to be truly amazing, and something that I definitely want to pursue. 









Primary questions:
1. What are your primary research interests and why do you think they are important?
2. How would participating in the AI Residency help you to explore your research interests and achieve your goals?
3. Give an example of an open-ended research question or project you’ve worked on. What made it challenging and how did you overcome those challenges? Alternatively, summarize and critique a machine learning paper you have read that you found interesting.
